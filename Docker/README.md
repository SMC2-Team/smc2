## SMC<sup>2</sup> Docker
First, ensure Docker is allocated 8GB of Memory. 
You can confirm or modify this in Docker's preferences (Docker -> Preferences -> Resources).
This will allow you enough space to have both PICCO and SMC2 installed and properly run programs with both on the same Docker image. 

### Docker Creation
This takes a bit, but only has to be done once. It builds the Docker image and runs [`install.sh`](install.sh). 
This command should be run from the outer [smc2](https://github.com/SMC2-Team/smc2) directory.
```
docker build -t smc2 .
```
Once this is complete, you will have a Docker image with our implementation of PICCO installed, and the benchmarking programs compiled. 

### Running Docker
Open a running, interactive container with the Docker created in the last step.
```
docker run -it --rm smc2
```

### Example Programs
We've stored our benchmarking programs within [`smc2/compute/example-programs`](../smc2/compute/example-programs). 
Each program has it's own directory, containing the program, example input, and corresponding expected output. 
The compiled program, utility file, input shares, and executable were added during the Docker creation when `install.sh` was run.
```
cd smc2/compute/example-programs
```

#### Compiling Examples
This step was already completed for our benchmarking programs during Docker creation, when [`install.sh`](install.sh) was ran.
We've provided a script to facilitate the process of compiling a program and obtaining input shares in [`compile.sh`](https://github.com/SMC2-Team/smc2/blob/main/smc2/compute/example-programs/compile.sh). The script contains comments to help you understand what is being done in various steps. 
```
bash compile.sh <program-name>
```


#### Running Examples
We've provided a script to facilitate the process of starting the multiparty computation for a single program in [`run.sh`](https://github.com/SMC2-Team/smc2/blob/main/smc2/compute/example-programs/run.sh). The script contains comments to help you understand what is being done in various steps. 
```
bash run.sh <program-name>
```
We do ***not*** suggest running [`private-branching-reuse`](https://github.com/SMC2-Team/smc2/tree/main/smc2/compute/example-programs/private-branching-reuse) with the Docker image unless you have increased the memory - in testing, with 6GB of memory, it takes around 14 minutes to complete. 

All other benchmarking programs should complete fairly quickly, with the fastest [`LR-parser`](https://github.com/SMC2-Team/smc2/tree/main/smc2/compute/example-programs/LR-parser)) completing in under a second and the second-slowest [`h_analysis`](https://github.com/SMC2-Team/smc2/tree/main/smc2/compute/example-programs/h_analysis) completing within one minute. You will know the program has finished running when it prints 3 times (one for each party) like so: 
```
Time: 0.005847
Time: 0.002881
Time: 0.007141
```

#### Obtaining Output
We've provided a script to facilitate the process of obtaining output from output shares in [`output.sh`](https://github.com/SMC2-Team/smc2/blob/main/smc2/compute/example-programs/output.sh). The script contains comments to help you understand what is being done in various steps. 
```
bash output.sh <program-name>
```
This script also checks the output against the expected output. If this command runs without anything printed to the terminal, then the expected and actual output files match. 


#### Adding Examples
If you'd like to add example programs, please follow the directory and naming scheme provided for the given examples.
Each program `new-program` should be in it's own directory `new-program/`, containing the program `new-program.c`, example input `input.txt`, and corresponding expected output `expected-output.out`.
This will enable the use of the given scripts, which facilitate compilation, running, and obtaining output. 

Each script gives details about the commands being run within the script. 
You can also find the [PICCO manual](https://github.com/PICCO-Team/picco/blob/master/picco-manual.pdf) in the main [PICCO repository](https://github.com/PICCO-Team/picco). The commands and information detailed here hold for our implementation as well.



## PICCO Docker Reference
- The Docker implementation for PICCO found [here](https://github.com/MPC-SoK/frameworks/tree/master/picco) was referred to when creating the Docker for SMC<sup>2</sup>, modifying their Dockerfile and install.sh.
- Citation:
> M. Hastings, B. Hemenway, D. Noble, and S. Zdancewic. SoK: General purpose compilers for secure multi-party computation. In IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&P), pages 1220â€“1237, 2019.


## Troubleshooting
#### The program I ran is taking longer than expected.
- Run `ps -u` to see if the parties are all still running and computing (using CPU). If not, or if they've been running for too long, kill them using their pid `kill <pid>`.
- Try closing the container (`ctrl+d`) and restarting the container (`docker run -it --rm smc2`).
Before restarting, check how much memory you've allotted to Docker (Docker -> Preferences -> Resources). Increasing the memory to 5GB should speed up the runtimes of the longer running programs vs. running with the default 2GB of memory. 

#### One of the computational parties failed.
Occassionally a connection will drop and you need to restart the program on all parties. 
Run `ps -u` to see which parties are still running, then kill them using their pid `kill <pid>`.
Now the resources will be freed up to restart the program.
