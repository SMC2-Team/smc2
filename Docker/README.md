### SMC<sup>2</sup> Docker











### PICCO Docker
- A docker for running PICCO can be found here: https://github.com/MPC-SoK/frameworks/tree/master/picco
- This docker uses a previous version of PICCO as compared to the version we tested against to obtain the results shown in our paper, so results may differ slightly but still be comparable to the `local` results.
- This Docker implementation was referred to when creating the Docker for SMC<sup>2</sup>, modifying their Dockerfile and install.sh.
