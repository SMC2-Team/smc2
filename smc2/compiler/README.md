# Compiler source code

This directory contains the compiler's source code for `picco`, `picco-utility`, and `picco-seed`. 
- `picco` is the main compiler, which is used to compile the source program.
- `picco-utility` handles splitting the input data into input shares, and obtaining the output data from output shares.
- `picco-seed` facilitates computation between parties at runtime.

To compile all three, run the following command:

```
bash compile.sh
```
